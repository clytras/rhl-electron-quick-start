# rhl-electron-quick-start

Based on [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) (read their 
README as well if you're new to Electron), this repo provides a very basic React Hot Loader setup.

Additions are:
- babel configuration
- webpack configurations for dev/production
- webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware in the server-side part of the app
- .editorconfig
